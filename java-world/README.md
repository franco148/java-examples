**JAVA GENERICS EXAMPLES**

In this section, I'll go through some examples about Generics in Java.

Generics are a core concept in Java, first introduced in Java 5. Because
of this, nearly all Java codebase will make use of them, almost guaranteeing
that a developer will run into them at some point. This is why it's essential
to understand them correctly.

Here some questions that I am going to cover in the following packages:

- What is a Generic Type Parameter?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q01
- What are some advantages of using Generic Types?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q02
- What is Type Erasure?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q03
- If a generic type is omitted when instantiating an object, will the code still compile?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q04
- How does Generic Method differ from a Generic Type?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q05
- What is Type Inference?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q06
- What is a bounded Type Parameter?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q07
- Is it possible to declare a multiple bounded Type Parameter?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q08
- What is a Wildcard Type?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q09
- What is an Upper Bounded Wildcard?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q10
- What is an Unbounded Wildcard?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q11
- What is a Lower Bounded Wildcard?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q12
- When would you choose to use a lower bounded Type vs. and Upper Bounded Type?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q13
- Are there any situations where Generic Type information is available at Runtime?
    - extreme.code.java.world.generics.q14
